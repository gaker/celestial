## Abstract

The planetary and lunar ephemerides called DE440 and DE441 have been generated by fitting numerically integrated orbits to ground-based and space-based observations. Compared to the previous general-purpose ephemerides DE430, seven years of new data have been added to compute DE440 and DE441, with improved dynamical models and data calibration. The orbit of Jupiter has improved substantially by fitting to the Juno radio range and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data of the Juno spacecraft. The orbit of Saturn has been improved by radio range and VLBA data of the Cassini spacecraft, with improved estimation of the spacecraft orbit. The orbit of Pluto has been improved from use of stellar occultation data reduced against the Gaia star catalog. The ephemerides DE440 and DE441 are fit to the same data set, but DE441 assumes no damping between the lunar liquid core and the solid mantle, which avoids a divergence when integrated backward in time. Therefore, DE441 is less accurate than DE440 for the current century, but covers a much longer duration of years -13,200 to +17,191, compared to DE440 covering years 1550--2650.

## 1. Introduction

Modern-day planetary ephemerides are computed by fitting numerically integrated orbits to various types of ground-based and space-based observations (Folkner et al. 2014; Pitjeva & Pitjev 2018; Fienga et al. 2020). The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) planetary and lunar ephemerides Development Ephemeris (DE) series includes the positions of the Sun, the barycenters of eight planetary systems, the Moon, the Pluto system barycenter, and lunar libration angles, as well as their associated velocities.

The high-precision orbits and lunar rotations around the three axes have a wide range of practical and fundamental applications (Thornton & Border 2003; Park et al. 2020b; Vallisneri et al. 2020; U.S. Nautical Almanac Office & Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office 2018). Without an update, however, the errors in orbits grow for several reasons. For Jupiter (Juno 2016--2020 < 12 yr period), Saturn (Cassini 2004--2018, <30 yr period), Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto the high-quality data are available for less than one orbit. For Mars, the range data is of high quality, but the main-belt asteroid masses are a limitation partly due to the large number of asteroids and partly due to long-period perturbations (Folkner et al. 2014). In the future, these errors grow nonlinearly with time.

The planetary and lunar ephemerides DE440 replaces DE430 released in 2014 (Folkner et al. 2014) and its precursors. Since the DE430 release, several interim ephemerides have been released. Each interim DE file was for a specific flight project, which has been tuned for the flight project's target body. For example, the last release was DE438 in 2018 for the Juno mission (Bolton et al. 2017). DE440 has updated all bodies using all available data, including the Moon, which has not been updated since DE430.

Since DE430, several updates have been made to the dynamical model used to integrate DE440:

- Perturbations from 30 individual Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and a circular ring representing the rest of the Kuiper belt, modeled as 36 point masses with an equal mass located at 44 au, have been added to the model (Pitjeva & Pitjev 2018).
- The Lense--Thirring (LT) effect from the Sun's angular momentum has also been added (Park et al. 2017).
- For the orientation of Earth, the Vondrak precession model has been used (Vondrak et al. 2011), which, according to Vondrak et al. (2009), is more accurate for integrations beyond +/-1000 years than the Lieske precession model (Lieske 1979) used for DE430.
- For the Moon, the effect of geodetic precession on lunar librations has been added as well as the solar radiation pressure force on the Earth--Moon system orbits.

Compared to DE430, new data spanning over about 7 years have been added to compute DE440:

- The shapes of Mercury, Venus, and Mars orbits are determined mainly by the radio range data of the MESSENGER, Venus Express, and Mars-orbiting spacecraft, respectively.
- The orientations of inner planet orbits are tied to the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) of Mars-orbiting spacecraft (Folkner & Border 2015; Park et al. 2015).
- The orbit of the Moon is determined from laser ranging to lunar retroreflectors.
- The orbit accuracy of Jupiter has improved substantially by fitting the orbit to the radio range and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data of the Juno spacecraft.
- The orbit of Saturn is determined by the radio range and VLBA data of the Cassini spacecraft, with improved spacecraft orbits used for processing the radio range data.
- The orbits of Uranus and Neptune are determined by astrometry and radio range measurements to the Voyager flybys.
- The orbit of Pluto is now mainly determined by stellar occultations reduced against the Gaia star catalog (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018; Desmars et al. 2019).

For the Moon, viscous damping between the liquid core and the solid mantle are observed in the lunar laser ranging (LLR) data. This implies an excitation of the relative motion of a lunar core and mantle in the past, possibly due to a spin/orbit resonance that occurred in geologically recent times (Rambaux & Williams 2011). Both DE440 and DE441 have been fit to the same data set, but DE441 assumed no damping between the lunar liquid core and the solid mantle. In this way, a divergence can be avoided when integrated backward for thousands of years. As a consequence, DE441 is less accurate than DE440 for the current century, but more accurate over longer past time spans.

**Time spans:**
- DE440: years 1550--2650
- DE441: years -13,200 to +17,191

The difference in the orbits of the planets between DE440 and DE441 are less than 1 m over the 1100 years of the DE440 time span. The difference in the orbit of the Moon between DE440 and DE441 is less than 2 m during the time span of the LLR data, i.e., 1970--2020, but increased over a longer time span, especially in the along-track direction (i.e., velocity direction).

In general, DE440 is recommended for analyzing modern data while DE441 is recommended for analyzing historical data earlier than the modern range data.

## 2. Coordinates of Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides

### 2.1. Inertial Reference Frame

The inertial coordinate frame of the planetary and lunar ephemerides is connected to the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS). The current ICRS realization is achieved by VLBI measurements of the positions of extragalactic radio sources (i.e., quasars) defined in the Third Realization of the International Celestial References Frame (ICRF3; Charlot et al. 2020), which is adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).

The orbits of the inner planets are tied to ICRF3 via VLBI measurements of Mars-orbiting spacecraft (Konopliv et al. 2016) with respect to quasars with positions known in the ICRF. Overall, the orientations of inner planet orbits are aligned with ICRF3 with an average accuracy of about 0.2 mas (Folkner & Border 2015; Folkner et al. 2014; Park et al. 2015).

The orbits of Jupiter and Saturn are tied to ICRF3 via VLBA measurements of Juno and Cassini spacecraft (Jones et al. 2020), respectively.

### 2.2. Solar System Barycenter

The solar system barycenter (SSBC) is defined as (Estabrook 1971):

$$\mathbf{r}_{\text{ssbc}} = \frac{\sum_i \mu_i^* \mathbf{r}_i}{\sum_i \mu_i^*} \tag{1}$$

Here, the summation is over all bodies with finite mass, $\mathbf{r}_i$ is the position of body $i$, and $\mu_i^*$ is defined as:

$$\mu_i^* = GM_i \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2c^2} v_i^2 - \frac{1}{2c^2} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{GM_j}{r_{ij}} \right) \tag{2}$$

where:
- $GM_i$ is the mass parameter of body $i$
- $c$ is the speed of light
- $v_i$ is the barycentric speed of body $i$
- $r_{ij} = |\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j|$ is the distance between bodies $i$ and $j$

For DE440, the bodies used for computing the SSBC were:
- The Sun
- Barycenters of eight planetary systems
- The Pluto system barycenter
- 343 asteroids
- 30 KBOs
- A KBO ring representing the main Kuiper belt

The 343 asteroids were the same set of asteroids used in DE430, which consist of ~90% of the total asteroid-belt mass. The mass of the 30 largest known KBOs were from Pitjeva & Pitjev (2018). The circular KBO ring was modeled as 36 point masses with equal mass located in the ecliptic plane with a semimajor axis of 44 au, with the ring mass estimated.

Compared to DE430, SSBC has shifted by ~100 km, which is mainly due to the addition of KBOs.

**Important note:** To the first order, Earth orbits around the Sun, not around the SSBC. The near-constant distance of the perihelion and aphelion of the EMB relative to the Sun indicates that solar inertial motion (SIM) does not affect the orbit of Earth relative to the Sun.

### 2.3. Ephemeris Coordinate Time

JPL's DE series are integrated using the barycentric dynamical time (TDB), which is defined relative to the barycentric coordinate time (TCB; Petit & Luzum 2009). All of the data used to compute DE440 and DE441 had the intrinsic time tag in the coordinated universal time (UTC), which differs from the international atomic time (TAI) by leap seconds (i.e., TAI = UTC + leap seconds).

In order to process these UTC-tagged measurements, the conversion from UTC to TDB would be needed (Soffel et al. 2003; Petit & Luzum 2009). Once the TAI time is computed, 32.184 s are added to compute the terrestrial time (TT):

$$\text{TT} = \text{TAI} + 32.184 \text{ s}$$

The conversion from TT to TDB (in Julian days) is given by:

$$\text{TDB} - \text{TT} = \frac{L_G - L_B}{1 - L_B}(\text{TDB} - T_0) + \frac{1 - L_G}{1 - L_B}\text{TDB}_0$$
$$+ \frac{1 - L_G}{1 - L_B} \int_{T_0 + \text{TDB}_0}^{\text{TDB}} \frac{1}{c^2} \left( \frac{v_E^2}{2} + w_{0E} + w_{LE} \right) dt$$
$$+ \frac{1}{c^2} \mathbf{v}_E \cdot (\mathbf{r}_S - \mathbf{r}_E) + \mathcal{O}(c^{-4}) \tag{3}$$

where:
- $L_G = 6.969290134 \times 10^{-10}$ defines the rate of TT with respect to geocentric coordinate time (TCG)
- $L_B = 1.550519768 \times 10^{-8}$ defines the rate of TDB with respect to TCB
- $T_0 = 2443144.5003725$ Julian days
- $\text{TDB}_0 = -65.5 \times 10^{-6} / 86400$ days
- $\mathbf{v}_E$ is the velocity of the Earth
- $\mathbf{r}_E$ is the position vector of the Earth
- $\mathbf{r}_S$ is the position vector of a measurement station

The potential term $w_{0E}$ is defined as:

$$w_{0E} = \sum_{i \neq E} \frac{GM_i}{r_{iE}} \tag{4}$$

with the summation over all bodies other than Earth.

The potential due to external oblate figures $w_{LE}$ is defined as:

$$w_{LE} = -\frac{GM_\odot J_{2\odot} R_\odot^2}{2|\mathbf{r}_\odot - \mathbf{r}_E|^3} (3\sin^2\varphi_{E,\odot} - 1) \tag{5}$$

where:
- $J_{2\odot}$ is the unnormalized second-degree gravitational zonal harmonic of the Sun
- $R_\odot$ is the solar radius
- $\varphi_{E,\odot}$ is the heliocentric ecliptic latitude of Earth

The term $w_{iE}$ is defined as:

$$w_{iE} = \sum_{i \neq E} \frac{GM_i v_i}{r_{iE}} \tag{6}$$

where the summation is over all bodies other than Earth.

Lastly, $\Delta_E$ is defined as:

$$\Delta_E = \sum_{i \neq E} \frac{GM_i}{r_{iE}} \left[ v_E^2 + 2v_i^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{GM_j}{r_{ij}} - \frac{\mathbf{a}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_E)}{2} \right] - \frac{\mathbf{v}_i \cdot (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_E)}{r_{iE}} \tag{7}$$

where $\mathbf{a}_i$ is the acceleration of body $i$ and the summation is over all bodies.

### 2.4. Orientation of the Moon

LLR measures the round-trip light time of a laser pulse between an Earth LLR station and a retroreflector on the Moon. Thus, LLR data are not only sensitive to where the Moon is, but they are also sensitive to its orientation.

The orientation of lunar exterior (mantle and crust, hereafter referred to as the mantle) is defined by the principal axes (PAs) of the undistorted lunar mantle, and thus its moment of inertia matrix is diagonal. The directions of the PAs are taken from analyses of the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) data (Konopliv et al. 2013; Lemoine et al. 2013).

The Euler angles that define the rotation from the PA frame to the inertial ICRF3 frame are:
- $\phi_m$: the angle from the X-axis of the inertial frame along the XY plane to the intersection of the mantle equator
- $\theta_m$: the inclination of the mantle equator from the inertial XY plane
- $\psi_m$: the longitude from the intersection of the inertial XY plane with the mantle equator along the mantle equator to the prime meridian

The rotation from the lunar PA frame (i.e., lunar mantle frame) to ICRF3 is given as:

$$\mathbf{r}_I = \mathcal{R}_z(-\phi_m) \mathcal{R}_x(-\theta_m) \mathcal{R}_z(-\psi_m) \mathbf{r}_{\text{PA}} \tag{8}$$

The Euler angles $\phi_m$, $\theta_m$, and $\psi_m$ are also known as lunar libration angles, stored in the DE440 and DE441 files.

The rotation matrices use the right-hand rule and are defined as:

$$\mathcal{R}_x(\alpha) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & +\cos\alpha & +\sin\alpha \\ 0 & -\sin\alpha & +\cos\alpha \end{bmatrix} \tag{9}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_y(\alpha) = \begin{bmatrix} +\cos\alpha & 0 & -\sin\alpha \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ +\sin\alpha & 0 & +\cos\alpha \end{bmatrix} \tag{10}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_z(\alpha) = \begin{bmatrix} +\cos\alpha & +\sin\alpha & 0 \\ -\sin\alpha & +\cos\alpha & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \tag{11}$$

These lunar libration angles are integrated simultaneously with the orbital motion. The equations of motion for the lunar libration angles are:

$$\dot{\phi}_m = (\omega_{m,x} \sin\psi_m + \omega_{m,y} \cos\psi_m) / \sin\theta_m \tag{12}$$

$$\dot{\theta}_m = \omega_{m,x} \cos\psi_m - \omega_{m,y} \sin\psi_m \tag{13}$$

$$\dot{\psi}_m = \omega_{m,z} - \dot{\phi}_m \cos\theta_m \tag{14}$$

where $\omega_{m,x}$, $\omega_{m,y}$, and $\omega_{m,z}$ represent the components of the lunar mantle angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}_m$ expressed in the mantle frame. The time derivatives of $\boldsymbol{\omega}_m$ are given in Section 4.

The lunar orientation model includes a fluid core. The orientation of the core with respect to the ICRF is represented by the Euler angles $\phi_c$, $\theta_c$, and $\psi_c$, which are also numerically integrated. Since the shape of the core/mantle boundary is modeled as fixed to the frame of the mantle, it is more convenient to express the core angular velocities with respect to the mantle frame.

The time derivatives of the core Euler angles are then given by:

$$\dot{\phi}_c = \omega_{c,z}^\dagger / \cos\theta_c \tag{15}$$

$$\dot{\theta}_c = \omega_{c,x}^\dagger \tag{16}$$

$$\dot{\psi}_c = -\omega_{c,y}^\dagger / \sin\theta_c \tag{17}$$

where the core angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}_c$ is related to the angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}_c^\dagger$ in a frame defined by the intersection of the core equator with the inertial XY plane by:

$$\boldsymbol{\omega}_c^\dagger = \mathcal{R}_z(\phi_c - \phi_m) \mathcal{R}_x(-\theta_m) \mathcal{R}_z(-\psi_m) \boldsymbol{\omega}_c \tag{18}$$

The time derivatives of $\boldsymbol{\omega}_c$ are given in Section 4.

Most lunar cartographic products are defined relative to the DE421 mean-Earth/mean-rotation (MER) frame. The MER frame is defined by the X-axis pointing toward the mean-Earth direction and the Z-axis pointing toward the mean-rotation axis direction.

The rotation from the DE440 PA frame to the DE421 MER frame is estimated by comparing the coordinates of the lunar retroreflectors estimated in the DE440 PA frame and the retroreflector coordinates in the DE421 MER frame, which yield:

$$\mathbf{r}_{\text{MER,DE421}} = \mathcal{R}_x(-0''.2785) \mathcal{R}_y(78''.6944) \mathcal{R}_z(-67''.8526) \mathbf{r}_{\text{PA,DE440}} \tag{19}$$

### 2.5. Orientation of Earth

Only the long-term change of the Earth orientation is modeled in the ephemeris integration. The Earth orientation model used for DE440 and DE441 is based on a long-term precession model (Vondrak et al. 2011) and a modified nutation model based on the IAU 1980 precession model including only terms with a period of 18.6 years.

The Earth pole unit vector in the inertial frame, $\mathbf{p}_E$, can be computed by the following steps.

First, the mean longitude of the ascending node of the lunar orbit measured on the ecliptic plane from the mean equinox of date is computed by:

$$\Omega = 125deg 02'40''.280 - 1934deg 08'10''.539 T + 7''.455 T^2 + 0''.008 T^3 \tag{20}$$

where $T$ is the TDB time in Julian centuries (36,525 days) from J2000.0.

The nutation angles in longitude, $\Delta\psi$, and obliquity, $\Delta\varepsilon$, are given by:

$$\Delta\psi = -17''.1996 \sin\Omega \tag{21}$$

$$\Delta\varepsilon = 9''.2025 \cos\Omega \tag{22}$$

The true pole of date unit vector, $\mathbf{p}_d$, is computed by rotating the Earth-fixed pole vector by the effect of the 18.6 year nutation term to give:

$$\mathbf{p}_d = \begin{bmatrix} \sin(\Delta\psi) \sin(\bar{\varepsilon} + \Delta\varepsilon) \\ \cos(\Delta\psi) \sin(\bar{\varepsilon} + \Delta\varepsilon) \cos(\bar{\varepsilon}) - \cos(\bar{\varepsilon} + \Delta\varepsilon) \sin(\bar{\varepsilon}) \\ \cos(\Delta\psi) \sin(\bar{\varepsilon} + \Delta\varepsilon) \sin(\bar{\varepsilon}) + \cos(\bar{\varepsilon} + \Delta\varepsilon) \cos(\bar{\varepsilon}) \end{bmatrix} \tag{23}$$

where the mean obliquity $\bar{\varepsilon}$ is given by:

$$\bar{\varepsilon} = 84381''.448 - 46''.815 T - 0''.00059 T^2 + 0''.001813 T^3 \tag{24}$$

The pole unit vector in the inertial frame $\mathbf{p}_E$ is computed by precessing the pole of date to inertial coordinates using the long-term precession model (Vondrak et al. 2011) plus an estimated frame offset in x and y rotations:

$$\mathbf{p}_E = \mathbf{V} \mathcal{R}_x(-\Phi_x) \mathcal{R}_y(-\Phi_y) \mathbf{p}_d \tag{25}$$

where $\Phi_x$ and $\Phi_y$ are the estimated offsets of the EME2000 pole from the ICRF pole and the precession matrix $\mathbf{V}$ is given by:

$$\mathbf{V} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{k} / |\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{k}| & (\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{k}) \times \mathbf{n} / |(\mathbf{n} \times \mathbf{k}) \times \mathbf{n}| & \mathbf{n} / |\mathbf{n}| \end{bmatrix} \tag{26}$$

where $\mathbf{k}$ is the ecliptic pole vector and $\mathbf{n}$ is the mean equatorial pole vector, derived from polynomial fits to a numerically integrated long-term orientation of Earth (Vondrak et al. 2011). The $|\cdot|$ operator represents the norm of a vector.

## 3. Translational Equations of Motion

This section presents the dynamical models of the planetary and lunar ephemerides, including changes and updates made compared to DE430.

### 3.1. Point-mass Acceleration

The point-mass interaction between planetary bodies is governed by the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formulation (Will & Nordtvedt 1972; Moyer 2003):

$$\mathbf{a}_{i,\text{pm}} = \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{GM_j (\mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i)}{r_{ij}^3} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{2(\beta + \gamma)}{c^2} \sum_{k \neq i} \frac{GM_k}{r_{ik}} - \frac{2\beta - 1}{c^2} \sum_{k \neq j} \frac{GM_k}{r_{jk}}$$

$$+ \gamma \left(\frac{v_i}{c}\right)^2 + (1 + \gamma) \left(\frac{v_j}{c}\right)^2 - \frac{2(1 + \gamma)}{c^2} \mathbf{v}_i \cdot \mathbf{v}_j - \frac{3}{2c^2} \left[ \frac{(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot \mathbf{v}_j}{r_{ij}} \right]^2 \Bigg\}$$

$$+ \frac{1}{c^2} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{GM_j}{r_{ij}^3} \Big\{ [(\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_j) \cdot ((2 + 2\gamma)\mathbf{v}_i - (1 + 2\gamma)\mathbf{v}_j)] (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \Big\}$$

$$+ \frac{3 + 4\gamma}{2c^2} \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{GM_j \mathbf{a}_j}{r_{ij}} \tag{27}$$

where:
- The summations are over all bodies
- $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the Eddington--Robertson--Schiff parameters representing the measure of nonlinearity in the superposition law for gravity and the amount of space curvature produced by a unit rest mass, respectively
- Both are constrained to unity as predicted by the general theory of relativity (GTR)

DE440 integrated the same set of bodies (i.e., Sun, barycenter of eight planets, the Moon, Pluto barycenter, and 343 asteroids) used in DE430, but also included perturbations from 30 KBOs and a KBO ring discussed in Section 2.2.

### 3.2. Point-mass Interaction with Extended Bodies

Nonspherical gravitational interaction has been modeled using a spherical harmonic expansion:
- For Earth: interaction of the zonal harmonics up to the fifth degree and the point masses of the Moon, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
- For the Moon: interaction of a degree and order 6 gravity field and the point masses of Earth, Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
- For the Sun: interaction of the second-degree zonal harmonic with all other bodies

The acceleration due to an extended body can be represented as:

$$\begin{bmatrix} \xi \\ \eta \\ \zeta \end{bmatrix} = -\frac{GM}{r^2} \Bigg\{ \sum_{n=2}^{n_1} J_n \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^n \begin{bmatrix} (n+1) P_n(\sin\varphi) \\ 0 \\ -\cos\varphi P_n'(\sin\varphi) \end{bmatrix}$$

$$+ \sum_{n=2}^{n_2} \sum_{m=1}^{n} \left(\frac{R}{r}\right)^n \begin{bmatrix} (n+1) P_{nm}(\sin\varphi)(C_{nm}\cos m\lambda + S_{nm}\sin m\lambda) \\ m\sec\varphi P_{nm}(\sin\varphi)(S_{nm}\cos m\lambda - C_{nm}\sin m\lambda) \\ -\cos\varphi P_{nm}'(\sin\varphi)(C_{nm}\cos m\lambda + S_{nm}\sin m\lambda) \end{bmatrix} \Bigg\} \tag{28}$$

where:
- The $\xi\eta\zeta$ coordinate system is defined such that the $\xi$-axis is defined outward from the extended body to the point mass, the $\xi\zeta$-plane contains the figure spin-pole of the extended body, and the $\eta$-axis completes the triad
- $r$ is the distance between the two bodies
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ represent the maximum degrees of the zonal and nonzonal spherical harmonic coefficients, respectively
- $P_n$ and $P_{nm}$ represent the unnormalized degree-$n$ Legendre polynomial and associated Legendre function with degree-$n$ and order-$m$, respectively
- $P_n'$ and $P_{nm}'$ represent the derivative of $P_n$ and $P_{nm}$ with respect to $\sin\varphi$, respectively
- $J_n$ represents the degree-$n$ zonal harmonic coefficient
- $C_{nm}$ and $S_{nm}$ represent the nonzonal spherical harmonic coefficients for the extended body
- $R$ represents the reference radius of the extended body
- $\lambda$ and $\varphi$ represent the longitude and latitude of the point mass in the extended-body fixed coordinate system

Once the accelerations are computed in the body fixed frame, they are transformed into the inertial frame for integration.

There is also an interaction between the figure of an extended body and a point mass, often called the indirect acceleration. Given $\mathbf{a}_{i,\text{fig}_i-\text{pm}_j}$, which denotes the acceleration of the extended body $i$ interacting with the point-mass external body $j$ expressed in an inertial frame, the corresponding indirect acceleration of the point mass, $\mathbf{a}_{j,\text{fig}_i-\text{pm}_j}$, is:

$$\mathbf{a}_{j,\text{fig}_i-\text{pm}_j} = -\frac{m_i}{m_j} \mathbf{a}_{i,\text{fig}_i-\text{pm}_j} \tag{29}$$

For the Moon, the second-degree spherical harmonic coefficients vary with time due to distortion by tides and rotation. These coefficients are computed from the moment of inertia tensors as a function of time. The second-degree spherical harmonic coefficients are given by:

$$J_{2,M}(t) = \frac{2I_{T,33}(t) - [I_{T,11}(t) + I_{T,22}(t)]}{2 m_M R_M^2} \tag{30}$$

$$C_{22,M}(t) = \frac{I_{T,22}(t) - I_{T,11}(t)}{4 m_M R_M^2} \tag{31}$$

$$C_{21,M}(t) = -\frac{I_{T,13}(t)}{m_M R_M^2} \tag{32}$$

$$S_{21,M}(t) = -\frac{I_{T,23}(t)}{m_M R_M^2} \tag{33}$$

$$S_{22,M}(t) = -\frac{I_{T,12}(t)}{2 m_M R_M^2} \tag{34}$$

where $I_{ij,T}$ represent the elements of the total lunar moment of inertia matrix (see Section 4), $m_M$ is the lunar mass, and $R_M$ is the lunar radius.

### 3.3. Acceleration of the Moon from Earth Tides

The lunar orbit is affected by the tides raised on Earth by the Sun and Moon. The tidal distortion of Earth can be modeled using the second-degree gravitational Love numbers, $k_{2j,E}$, where the order $j$ is 0, 1, and 2 for long-period, diurnal, and semidiurnal responses, respectively. See Section 2.2 in Williams & Boggs (2016) for more information.

A time-delay tidal model has been applied to account for the tidal dissipation. The distorted response of Earth is delayed with respect to the tide-raising forces from the Moon or Sun. The appropriate time delay depends on the period of each tidal component. Consequently, different time delays have been employed for each order $j$. To allow for time delays shifting across the diurnal and semidiurnal frequency bands, separate time delays are associated with Earth's rotation and the lunar orbit.

The acceleration of the Moon due to the Earth tides is evaluated separately for the tides raised by the Sun and the tides raised by the Moon. The Earth tides depend on the position of the tide-raising body with respect to Earth, $\mathbf{r}_T$, where $T$ can denote either the Sun or the Moon. The position of the tide-raising body is evaluated at an earlier time $t - \tau_j'$, where $\tau_j'$ denotes the orbital time lag, for long-period ($j = 0$), diurnal ($j = 1$), and semi-diurnal ($j = 2$) responses.

The rotational distortion of Earth is delayed by a rotational time lag $\tau_j$, so that the distortion leads the direction to the tide-raising body by an angle $\dot{\theta} \tau_j$, where $\dot{\theta}$ is the rotation rate of Earth. The long-period zonal tides ($j = 0$) do not depend on the rotation of Earth, so $\tau_j = 0$.

The acceleration of the Moon due to the distorted Earth depends on the position of the Moon with respect to Earth ($\mathbf{r}$) and on the modified position vector for the tide-raising body ($\mathbf{r}_j^*$) that is given for each order $j$ by:

$$\mathbf{r}_j^* = \mathcal{E}^{-1} \mathcal{R}_z(-\dot{\theta}\tau_j) \mathcal{E} \mathbf{r}_T(t - \tau_j') \tag{35}$$

where $\mathcal{E}$ rotates the time-delayed position of the tide-raising body with respect to Earth from the inertial frame to the Earth fixed frame and $\mathcal{R}_z$ here means a right-handed rotation of the vector $\mathbf{r}_T(t - \tau_j')$ by the angle $-\dot{\theta}\tau_j$ about Earth's rotation axis.

For evaluation of the acceleration of the Moon, the vectors $\mathbf{r}$ (Moon with respect to Earth) and $\mathbf{r}_j^*$ (time-delayed position of a tide-raising body with respect to Earth) are expressed in cylindrical coordinates with the Z-axis perpendicular to Earth's equator so that $\mathbf{r} = \boldsymbol{\rho} + \mathbf{z}$ and $\mathbf{r}_j^* = \boldsymbol{\rho}_j^* + \mathbf{z}_j^*$.

The acceleration of the Moon due to the tide raised on Earth by each tide-raising body (Sun or Moon), $\mathbf{a}_{M,\text{tide}}$ is given by:

$$\mathbf{a}_{M,\text{tide}} = \frac{3}{2} \left( \frac{m_E + m_M}{m_E} \right) \frac{G m_T R_E^5}{r^5} \Bigg\{$$

$$\frac{k_{20,E}}{r_0^{*5}} \left[ 2z_0^{*2}\mathbf{z} + \rho_0^{*2}\boldsymbol{\rho} - \frac{5\left[(z z_0^*)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(\boldsymbol{\rho} \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho}_0^*)^2\right]\mathbf{r}}{r^2} \right]$$

$$+ \frac{k_{21,E}}{r_1^{*5}} \left[ 2z z_1^* \boldsymbol{\rho}_1^* + 2\rho_1^{*2} z_1^* \hat{\mathbf{z}} + (\boldsymbol{\rho} \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho}_1^*)\mathbf{z}_1^* - \frac{5\left[2z z_1^*(\boldsymbol{\rho} \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho}_1^*)\right]\mathbf{r}}{r^2} \right]$$

$$+ \frac{k_{22,E}}{r_2^{*5}} \left[ 2(\boldsymbol{\rho} \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho}_2^*)\boldsymbol{\rho}_2^* - \rho_2^{*2}\boldsymbol{\rho} - \frac{5(\boldsymbol{\rho} \cdot \boldsymbol{\rho}_2^*)^2 \mathbf{r}}{2r^2} \right] \Bigg\} \tag{36}$$

**Note:** Equation 36 is complex and the PDF text extraction was partially garbled. The notation above follows the structure from Williams & Boggs (2016) Section 2.2. For authoritative reference, consult the original PDF Figure/Equation directly.

where $m_T$ is the mass of the tide-raising body.

The tidal acceleration due to tidal dissipation is implicit in the above acceleration. Tides raised on Earth by the Moon do not influence the motion of the EMB. The effect of Sun-raised tides on the barycentric motion is not considered.

The tidal bulge leads the Moon and its gravitational attraction accelerates the Moon forward and retards Earth's spin. Energy and angular momentum are transferred from Earth's rotation to the lunar orbit. Consequently, the Moon moves away from Earth, the lunar orbit period lengthens, and Earth's day becomes longer. Some energy is dissipated in Earth rather than being transferred to the orbit.

### 3.4. Lense--Thirring Acceleration

In DE440, the acceleration of each body other than the Sun due to the gravito-magnetic effect of GTR, also known as the Lense--Thirring (LT) effect, has been implemented (Moyer 2003; Park et al. 2017):

$$\mathbf{a}_{i,\text{LT}} = 2\boldsymbol{\Omega}_i \times \mathbf{v}_i \tag{37}$$

where the LT angular velocity vector $\boldsymbol{\Omega}_i$ is given by:

$$\boldsymbol{\Omega}_i = \frac{(1 + \gamma) G}{2 c^2 r_i^3} \left[ -\mathbf{J} + \frac{3(\mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{r}_i)\mathbf{r}_i}{r_i^2} \right] \tag{38}$$

$$\mathbf{J} = C_\odot M_\odot R_\odot^2 \omega_\odot \hat{\mathbf{p}}_\odot \tag{39}$$

where:
- $G$ is the universal gravitational constant
- $\gamma$ is the Eddington--Robertson--Schiff parameter from Section 3.1
- $c$ is the speed of light
- $\mathbf{r}_i$ is position of the body with respect to the Sun
- $M_\odot$ is the Sun's mass
- $C_\odot$ is the Sun's polar moment of inertia divided by $M_\odot R_\odot^2$, where $C_\odot / (M_\odot R_\odot^2) = 0.06884$
- $R_\odot$ is the Sun's equatorial radius (696,000 km)
- $\omega_\odot$ is the Sun's rotation rate (14.1844 deg/day)
- $\hat{\mathbf{p}}_\odot$ is the unit spin-pole direction of the Sun (R.A. of 286deg .13 and decl. of 63deg .87; Archinal et al. 2018)

The LT effect is small, but it is important for fitting the MESSENGER range data (Park et al. 2017). Overall, the LT effect causes Mercury's perihelion to precess at the rate of about -0arcsec.0020/Julian century, which is about 7% of the precession caused by the solar oblateness.

### 3.5. Solar Radiation Pressure

Photons carry energy and momentum so there is a very small force directed away from the Sun. Like Newtonian gravity, solar radiation pressure depends on the inverse-square distance of the Sun. A simple solar radiation pressure model has been implemented for Earth and the Moon, with accelerations given by:

$$\mathbf{a}_{E,\text{srp}} = -\varepsilon_{E,\text{srp}} \frac{GM_{\text{Sun}} \mathbf{r}_{SE}}{r_{SE}^3} \tag{40}$$

$$\mathbf{a}_{M,\text{srp}} = -\varepsilon_{M,\text{srp}} \frac{GM_{\text{Sun}} \mathbf{r}_{SM}}{r_{SM}^3} \tag{41}$$

where:
- The acceleration due to solar radiation pressure is a very small fraction of gravitational acceleration (Vokrouhlicky 1997)
- $\varepsilon_{E,\text{srp}} = 2 \times 10^{-14}$ for Earth
- $\varepsilon_{M,\text{srp}} = 1.44 \times 10^{-13}$ for the Moon
- $\mathbf{r}_{SE}$ is the inertial Sun-to-Earth position vector
- $\mathbf{r}_{SM}$ is the inertial Sun-to-Moon position vector

## 4. Rotational Dynamics of the Moon

The Moon is modeled as an anelastic mantle with a liquid core. The orientations of the core and mantle are numerically integrated for the core and mantle angular velocities. The angular momentum vectors of the mantle and core are the product of the angular velocities and the moments of inertia. The angular momentum vectors change with time due to torques and due to the distortion of the mantle.

### 4.1. Rate of Change of Lunar Angular Velocities

In a rotating system, the change in angular velocity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is related to torques $\mathbf{N}$ by:

$$\frac{d}{dt}(\mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}) = \mathbf{N} + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}) \tag{42}$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the moment of inertia tensor. The second term on the right-hand side puts the time derivative into the rotating system.

The total lunar moment of inertia $\mathbf{I}_T$, which is the sum of the moment of inertia of the mantle $\mathbf{I}_m$ and the moment of inertia of the core $\mathbf{I}_c$, is proportional to the mass $m_M$ times the square of the radius $R_M$. Because the fractional uncertainty in the constant of gravitation $G$ is much larger than that for the lunar mass parameter $G m_M$, Equation (42) is evaluated in the integration with both sides multiplied by $G$.

The components of vectors can be given in the inertial frame, mantle frame, or other frames. Since the moment of inertia matrices are nearly diagonal in the mantle frame, there is great convenience to inverting matrices and performing the matrix multiplications in the mantle frame. The resulting vector components can then be rotated to other frames if desired.

The moment of inertia of the mantle varies with time due to tidal distortions. The distortions are functions of the lunar position and rotational velocities computed at time $t - \tau_m$, where $\tau_m$ is a time lag determined from the fits to the LLR data. The time delay allows for dissipation when flexing the Moon.

The time derivative of the angular velocity of the mantle is given by:

$$\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_m = \mathbf{I}_m^{-1} \left[ \sum_{j \neq M} \mathbf{N}_{M,\text{fig}_M-\text{pm}_j} + \mathbf{N}_{M,\text{fig}_M-\text{fig}_E} - \dot{\mathbf{I}}_m \boldsymbol{\omega}_m - (\boldsymbol{\omega}_m - \boldsymbol{\nu}_{\text{gp}}) \times \mathbf{I}_m \boldsymbol{\omega}_m + \mathbf{N}_{\text{cmb}} \right] \tag{43}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{I}_m$ is the lunar mantle moment of inertia matrix
- $\mathbf{N}_{M,\text{fig}_M-\text{pm}_j}$ is the torque on the lunar mantle due to the point-mass body $j$
- $\mathbf{N}_{M,\text{fig}_M-\text{fig}_E}$ is the torque on the lunar mantle due to the interaction between the extended figure of the Moon and the extended figure of Earth
- $\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\text{gp}}$ is the angular rate due to geodetic precession
- $\mathbf{N}_{\text{cmb}}$ is the torque due to the interaction between lunar mantle and core

The geodetic precession rate is defined as:

$$\boldsymbol{\nu}_{\text{gp}} = \frac{(1 + 2\gamma)}{2c^2} \mathbf{L} \left( \mathbf{v}_{EM} \times \left[ \frac{GM_{\text{Earth}} \mathbf{r}_{EM}}{r_{EM}^3} + \frac{GM_{\text{Sun}} \mathbf{r}_{SM}}{r_{SM}^3} \right] \right) \tag{44}$$

where:
- $\mathbf{L}$ is the rotation matrix from the mean J2000 frame to the lunar body fixed (i.e., selenographic) frame
- $\mathbf{v}_{EM}$ is the inertial Earth-to-Moon velocity vector
- $\mathbf{r}_{EM}$ is the inertial Earth-to-Moon position vector
- $\mathbf{r}_{SM}$ is the inertial Sun-to-Moon position vector

The fluid core is assumed to be rotating like a solid and constrained by the shape of the core--mantle boundary at the interior of the mantle, with the moment of inertia constant in the frame of the mantle. The time derivative of the angular velocity of the core expressed in the mantle frame is given by:

$$\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_c = \mathbf{I}_c^{-1} \left[ -(\boldsymbol{\omega}_m - \boldsymbol{\nu}_{\text{gp}}) \times \mathbf{I}_c \boldsymbol{\omega}_c - \mathbf{N}_{\text{cmb}} \right] \tag{45}$$

where $\mathbf{I}_c$ is the lunar core moment of inertia matrix.

### 4.2. Lunar Moments of Inertia

In the mantle frame, the undistorted moment of inertia of the mantle and the moment of inertia of the core are diagonal. The undistorted total moment of inertia $\bar{\mathbf{I}}_T$ is given by:

$$\bar{\mathbf{I}}_T = \begin{bmatrix} A_T & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & B_T & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & C_T \end{bmatrix} \tag{46}$$

with $A_T$, $B_T$, and $C_T$ given by:

$$A_T = m_M R_M^2 \tilde{J}_{2,M} \frac{2(1 - \beta_L - \gamma_L)}{(\beta_L - \gamma_L + \beta_L \gamma_L)} \tag{47}$$

$$B_T = m_M R_M^2 \tilde{J}_{2,M} \frac{2(1 + \gamma_L)}{(\beta_L - \gamma_L + \beta_L \gamma_L)} \tag{48}$$

$$C_T = m_M R_M^2 \tilde{J}_{2,M} \frac{2(1 + \beta_L)}{(\beta_L - \gamma_L + \beta_L \gamma_L)} \tag{49}$$

where:
- $m_M$ is the mass of the Moon
- $R_M$ is the reference radius of the Moon
- $\tilde{J}_{2,M}$ is the second-degree zonal harmonic of the undistorted Moon
- $\beta_L$ and $\gamma_L$ are ratios of the undistorted moments of inertia given by:

$$\beta_L = \frac{C_T - A_T}{B_T} \tag{50}$$

$$\gamma_L = \frac{B_T - A_T}{C_T} \tag{51}$$

The undistorted total moment of inertia and the second-degree zonal harmonic of the undistorted Moon are not the same as the mean values since the tidal distortions have non-zero averages.

We assume that the lunar rotation aligns an oblate core--mantle boundary with the equator. Then the moment of inertia of the core $\mathbf{I}_c$ is given by:

$$\mathbf{I}_c = \alpha_c C_T \begin{bmatrix} 1 - f_c & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 - f_c & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} A_c & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & B_c & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & C_c \end{bmatrix} \tag{52}$$

where:
- $\alpha_c = C_c / C_T$ is the ratio of the core polar moment of inertia to the undistorted total polar moment of inertia
- $f_c$ is the core oblateness

Distortion of the core moment of inertia is not considered.

The undistorted moment of inertia of the mantle is the difference between the undistorted total moment of inertia and the core moment of inertia:

$$\bar{\mathbf{I}}_m = \bar{\mathbf{I}}_T - \mathbf{I}_c \tag{53}$$

The moment of inertia of the mantle varies with time due to tidal distortion by Earth and spin distortion:

$$\mathbf{I}_m(t) = \bar{\mathbf{I}}_m - \frac{k_{2,M} m_E R_M^5}{r^5} \begin{bmatrix} x^2 - \frac{1}{3}r^2 & xy & xz \\ xy & y^2 - \frac{1}{3}r^2 & yz \\ xz & yz & z^2 - \frac{1}{3}r^2 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$- \frac{k_{2,M} R_M^5}{Gn^5} \begin{bmatrix} \omega_{m,x}^2 - \frac{1}{3}\omega_m^2 & \omega_{m,x}\omega_{m,y} & \omega_{m,x}\omega_{m,z} \\ \omega_{m,x}\omega_{m,y} & \omega_{m,y}^2 - \frac{1}{3}\omega_m^2 & \omega_{m,y}\omega_{m,z} \\ \omega_{m,x}\omega_{m,z} & \omega_{m,y}\omega_{m,z} & \omega_{m,z}^2 - \frac{1}{3}\omega_m^2 \end{bmatrix} \tag{54}$$

where the position vector of Earth relative to Moon, r, and the angular velocity of the mantle, omega_m, are evaluated at time t - tau_m; k_2,M is the lunar potential Love number; m_E is the mass of Earth; R_M is the reference radius of the Moon; r is the Earth-Moon distance; x, y, and z are the components of the position of Earth relative to the Moon referred to the mantle frame; omega_m,x, omega_m,y, omega_m,z are the components of omega_m in the mantle frame; and n is the lunar mean motion.

The rate of change of the mantle's moment of inertia is given by:

```
I_m_dot = -(5 * k_2,M * m_E * R_M^5 / r^7) * [r_dot * M1]
          -(k_2,M * m_E * R_M^5 / r^5) * M2
          -(k_2,M * R_M^5 / (G * n^5)) * M3
```

where M1, M2, M3 are 3x3 matrices involving position and velocity components (see Equation 55 in original paper for full matrix expressions).

### 4.3. Lunar Torques

The torque on the Moon due to an external point-mass A is given by:

```
N_M,fig_M-pm_A = M_M * r_AM x a_M,fig_M-pm_A       (Eq. 56)
```

where r_AM is the position of the point mass relative to the Moon and a_M,fig_M-pm_A is the acceleration of the Moon due to the interaction of the extended figure of the Moon with the point-mass A, as described in Section 3.2. Torques are computed for the figure of the Moon interacting with Earth, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

It can be shown that torques due to the interaction of the figure of the Moon with the figure of Earth are important for the orientation of the Moon (Eckhardt 1981). The three most significant terms of the torque are:

```
N_M,fig_M-fig_E = (15 * G * M_E * R_E^2 * J_2,E / (2 * r_EM^5)) * {
    (1 - 7*sin^2(phi_M,E)) * [r_EM_hat x I_M * r_EM_hat]
    + 2*sin(phi_M,E) * [r_EM_hat x I_M * p_E_hat + p_E_hat x I_M * r_EM_hat]
    - (2/5) * [p_E_hat x I_M * p_E_hat]
}                                                   (Eq. 57)
```

where:
- p_E is the direction vector of Earth's pole
- r_EM_hat is the direction vector of Earth from the Moon
- I_M is the lunar moment of inertia tensor
- R_E is the reference radius of Earth
- phi_M,E is defined by sin(phi_M,E) = r_EM_hat . p_E_hat

The torque on the mantle due to the interaction between the core and mantle is evaluated in the mantle frame and is given by:

```
N_cmb = -k_v * (C_c - A_c) * (omega_c - omega_m) - (C_c - A_c) * (z_m_hat . omega_c) * (z_m_hat x omega_m)    (Eq. 58)
```

where z_m_hat is a unit vector in the mantle frame aligned with the polar axis. Parameter k_v is for the viscous interaction at the core-mantle boundary. The torque on the core is the negative of the torque on the mantle.

## 5. Observational Data Used for Computing DE440 and DE441

The observations that have been used to compute DE440 and DE441 are summarized in Tables 3-5 for each body.

### Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR)

An LLR observation measures the round-trip light time from an LLR station on Earth to a retroreflector on the Moon. There are five retroreflectors on the Moon: the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 landing sites and the Lunokhod 2 and 1 rovers. The LLR measurements started in 1970 following the first landings of astronauts and continue to the present.

The LLR residuals can be expressed as one-way range residuals:
```
one-way residual = (t_measured - t_computed) / 2
```

The LLR measurement accuracy has improved with time as technology for producing short-duration high-energy laser pulses and timing measurements has advanced.

### Spacecraft Measurements

Spacecraft measurements are based on the Deep Space Network (DSN) radio range, Doppler, and VLBI measurements. For spacecraft in orbit about the planet, the Doppler measurements are typically used to estimate the position of the spacecraft with respect to the planet's center of mass and then range and VLBI measurements are used to estimate the orbit of the planet. For spacecraft flying by a planet, the range, Doppler, and VLBI data, as available, are used to estimate both the trajectory of the spacecraft and a 3D position of the planet, given as range, R.A., and decl.

Range measurements to spacecraft are usually made at regular intervals during a tracking pass, typically every 10 minutes, while Doppler measurements are made more frequently, typically every minute. Both range and Doppler measurements are based on the measurement of the phase of a radio signal, with the carrier signal used for Doppler and a ranging modulation signal used for range.

Since the carrier signal is at a much higher frequency and usually has much higher signal strength, Doppler measurements change in range much more accurately than the range measurements. Because of the shorter wavelength associated with the higher frequency, the integer number of carrier wavelengths cannot be resolved, so Doppler measurements do not allow for an estimation of absolute range. Range measurements are more accurate measurements of round-trip light time.

For plotting residuals, one-way residuals are used:
```
one-way range = (t_measured - t_computed) / 2
```

The range measurement accuracy is often limited by a calibration of the signal path delay in the tracking station prior to each tracking pass. Since this calibration error is common to all range measurements in the tracking pass, there is only one statistically independent range point per pass. Therefore, only one range point per tracking pass was used in the data reduction.

### VLBI Measurements

Spacecraft VLBI measurements are usually made using two widely separated tracking stations. The measurements are made using a modulation on the carrier signal (delta-differential one-way range) and give one component of the direction to the spacecraft (Thornton & Border 2003). The angular component direction depends on the baseline used:

- Goldstone-Madrid baseline: nearly parallel to Earth's equator, measures angular component close to R.A.
- Goldstone-Canberra baseline: ~45 degrees relative to equator, measures component approximately mid-way between R.A. and decl.

For Cassini and Juno (and a few points for Mars orbiters), VLBA was used, where the difference in the time of arrival of the spacecraft carrier signal was used to determine both components of the direction to the spacecraft.

### Astrometric Measurements

Astrometric measurements record the direction to the planet, namely, R.A. and decl., based on imaging relative to a star field. The accuracy of the star catalog is often the largest source of measurement error.

Types:
- CCD: Modern observations using electronic detectors, generally referred to star catalogs based on the Hipparcos mission (launched 1991), referred to the ICRF2 through estimation of radio star positions using VLBI
- Photographic/Transit: Older measurements, often referred to older star catalogs but corrected to Hipparcos catalog
- Relative: Barnard measured angular separation between outer planets and some satellites relative to nearby stars at Yerkes Observatory; star positions taken from modern catalogs

Transit observations cover a longer time span than more modern spacecraft and astrometric measurements. Since the measurement noise is relatively large for transit measurements, they do not contribute significantly to the ephemeris solution but are included for historical comparison.

### Occultation Measurements

Occultation measurements of Pluto determine R.A. and decl. from the timed disappearance and reappearance of a star occulted by Pluto (Desmars et al. 2019).

## 6. Conclusions

This paper presents JPL's new general-purpose ephemerides DE440 and DE441 created by fitting numerically integrated orbits to ground-based and space-based observations.

### Key improvements over DE430:

1. **New data:** ~7 years of additional observations added

2. **Inner planets:**
   - Mercury, Venus, Mars orbit shapes constrained mainly by radio range data (MESSENGER, Venus Express, Mars orbiters)
   - Inner planet orbit orientations tied to ICRF via VLBI of Mars orbiters

3. **Moon:**
   - Determined by laser ranging to lunar retroreflectors
   - Data arc extended through 2020 March

4. **Jupiter:**
   - Orbit accuracy improved substantially by fitting to new Juno radio ranges and VLBA data

5. **Saturn:**
   - Determined by radio ranges and VLBA data of Cassini spacecraft
   - Improved calibration of radio range data

6. **Uranus and Neptune:**
   - Constrained by astrometry and radio range measurements to Voyager flybys

7. **Pluto:**
   - Constrained by stellar occultation data reduced against Gaia star catalog

### Time spans:
- **DE440:** years 1550-2650 (recommended for analyzing modern data)
- **DE441:** years -13,200 to +17,191 (recommended for analyzing historic data before DE440 time span)
