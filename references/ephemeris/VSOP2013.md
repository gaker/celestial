## Abstract

**Context.** The development of precise numerical integrations of the motion of the planets, taking into account the most recent observations, lead us to improve the two families of analytical planetary theories built in the Institut de mecanique celeste et de calcul des ephemerides (IMCCE), the Variations Seculaires des Orbites Planetaires (VSOP) and the Theory of the Outer Planets (TOP) theories.

**Aims.** We have built the solutions VSOP2010 and TOP2010 fitted to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) numerical integration DE405 and the solutions VSOP2013 and TOP2013 fitted to the European recent numerical integration INPOP10a. This paper specifically considers VSOP2013 and TOP2013.

**Methods.** We have improved the construction of VSOP by analytically computing the perturbations due to the asteroids and to Pluto. We have increased the precision of the VSOP solutions of Jupiter and Saturn by using TOP solutions. We have also improved the construction of TOP by computing the perturbations due to the telluric planets from VSOP solutions. Moreover, TOP contains a solution of the motion of the Pluto-Charon barycenter.

**Results.** From 1890 to 2000, the precision of VSOP2013 goes from a few 0.01 mas (planets except Mars and Uranus) up to 0.7 mas (Mars and Uranus). Compared to the previous solution (VSOP2000), this represents an improvement of a factor of 2 to 24, depending on the planet. From -4000 to 8000, the precision is of a few 0.1 arcsec for the telluric planets (1.6 arcsec for Mars), i.e. an improvement of about a factor of 5 compared to VSOP2000. The TOP2013 solution is the best for the motion of the major planets from -4000 to 8000. Its precision is of a few 0.1 arcsec for the four planets, i.e. a gain between 1.5 and 15, depending on the planet compared to VSOP2013. The precision of the theory of Pluto remains valid up to the time span from 0 to 4000. The VSOP2013 and TOP2013 data are available on the WEB server of the IMCCE.

**Key words:** celestial mechanics -- ephemerides

## 1. Introduction

For the last 30 years, two kinds of analytical planetary theories have been built in the Institut de mecanique celeste et de calcul des ephemerides (IMCCE): the Variations Seculaires des Orbites Planetaires (VSOP) theories, essentially issued from the research works of P. Bretagnon, and the Theory of Outer Planets (TOP) theories, derived from the works of J.-L. Simon.

The VSOP theories are solutions for the motion of the eight planets in the solar system; they are very precise over a time span of about 1000 years and the ephemerides published by the IMCCE from 1984 to 2006 were derived from VSOP. The TOP theories are solutions for the motion of the four major planets and are accurate over several thousands of years.

Currently, the ephemerides of the planets are obtained mainly from very precise numerical integrations fitted to the most recent observations: the European ephemerides Integration Numerique Planetaire de l'Observatoire de Paris (INPOP, Fienga et al. 2008, 2009, 2011), the American ephemerides Development Ephemeris (DE; e.g. Standish 1998; or more recently Folkner et al. 2009; Folkner 2010) and the Russian ephemerides Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon (EPM; Pitjeva 2005, 2010).

Nevertheless, the construction of analytical planetary theories remains useful:
1. Even if the aim of analytical theories is not to compete with numerical integrations for space engineering, they can provide precise ephemerides for the concern of most astronomers
2. Their precision slowly decreases with time and they remain accurate over several thousand years
3. They allow a precise analysis of the perturbations
4. They are useful for some problems such as the study of the Earth's rotation
5. From these theories it is possible to obtain compact solutions of good precision

We first built the analytical solutions VSOP2010 and TOP2010, fitted to DE405 (Standish 1998). We then built VSOP2013 and TOP2013, fitted to INPOP10a (Fienga et al. 2011). This paper particularly deals with VSOP2013 and TOP2013.

**Note:** The word "theory" is a traditional term used in celestial mechanics for the analytical solution of the equations of the motion of solar system bodies.

## 2. Common Characteristics

The two solutions VSOP and TOP have several characteristics in common.

### 2.1. Variables and Equations

The variables used are the elliptic variables:
- $a$ = semi-major axis
- $\lambda$ = mean longitude
- $k = e \cos \varpi$
- $h = e \sin \varpi$
- $q = \sin(i/2) \cos \Omega$
- $p = \sin(i/2) \sin \Omega$

where $e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit, $\varpi$ is the longitude of perihelion, $i$ is the inclination to the ecliptic J2000, and $\Omega$ is the longitude of the ascending node.

The equations of the motion of the planets are the Lagrange differential equations (for the computing of the second members of the Lagrange equations, see Chapront et al. 1975).

### 2.2. Form of the Solutions

There are two kinds of analytical planetary theories: general planetary theories and classical planetary theories.

In **general planetary theories**, the variables are developed under the form of Fourier series, with arguments being linear combinations of short-period arguments (mean longitudes of the planets) and long-period arguments (longitudes of nodes and perihelia).

Developing the long-period arguments with respect to time, we obtain the **classical planetary theories** under the form of Poisson series, with arguments being linear combinations of short-period arguments.

The VSOP and TOP solutions are classical planetary theories. For a planet $j$, we note that $x_j$ are the elements other than mean longitudes $\lambda_j$; $x_j$ and $\lambda_j$ have the form:

$$x_j = x_j^0 + x_j^1 t + \ldots + x_j^p t^p + X_j^0 + t X_j^1 + \ldots + t^p X_j^p \tag{1}$$

$$\lambda_j = \lambda_j^0 + n_j t + l_j^2 t^2 + \ldots + l_j^p t^p + L_j^0 + t L_j^1 + \ldots + t^p L_j^p$$

where $t$ is the time (the timescale will be explained in the following sections), $x_j^0, \ldots, x_j^p$ and $\lambda_j^0, n_j, \ldots, l_j^p$ are numerical coefficients, and $X_j^q$ and $L_j^q$ are Fourier series of short-period arguments the form of which will be explained in the following sections.

### 2.3. Integration of the Equations

- Results of the integration are obtained in the following way. First, the perturbations are built order by order up to the third order with respect to the masses. An iterative method is then used for the following computations.

- The integration constants $x_j^0$ and $\lambda_j^0$ and the mean motions $n_j$ are determined by fitting, over the time span from 1890 to 2000, the solutions to the numerical integrations DE405 (Standish 1998) for the solutions VSOP2010 and TOP2010 or INPOP10a (Fienga et al. 2011) for VSOP2013 and TOP2013.

## 3. The VSOP Theories

The VSOP theories are analytical theories for the eight planets: Mercury, Venus, the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

### 3.1. Historical Review

**VSOP82** (Bretagnon 1982): In this solution, the iterative method was developed up to the fifth order with respect to the masses. The relativity was introduced by the Schwarzschild problem and the perturbations of the Earth-Moon barycenter by the Moon were taken into account. The arguments of the Poisson series were the mean mean longitudes of the planets and the Delaunay arguments of the Moon $D$, $F$, and $L$. The mean mean longitudes are linear functions of time defined for each planet $j$ by:

$$\bar{\lambda}_j = \lambda_j^0 + n_j t \tag{2}$$

where $n_j$ is the mean motion of the planet $j$. VSOP82 was fitted to the numerical integration of the JPL, DE200 (Standish 1982). The timescale is barycentric dynamical time (TDB) obtained from Fairhead & Bretagnon (1990).

**VSOP87** (Bretagnon & Francou 1988): This solution was an extension of VSOP82, also fitted to DE200. The solutions were expressed with elliptic elements and also with rectangular $(X, Y, Z)$ or spherical (longitude, latitude, and radius vector) variables. The reference frames were the ecliptic and equinox J2000 or the ecliptic and equinox of the date. The coordinates were heliocentric or barycentric.

**VSOP2000** (Moisson & Bretagnon 2001): This solution was an improvement of VSOP82. The iterative method was developed up to the eighth order of the masses. The perturbations by the five big asteroids Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Iris, and Bamberga were introduced during the iterations. Second order perturbations by the Moon on Mercury, Venus, the Earth-Moon barycenter, and Mars were computed. Relativistic corrections were also introduced in the iterations. The arguments of the series were linear combinations of 16 angles: the mean mean longitudes of the eight major planets and of the five big asteroids, and the three Delaunay angles of the Moon. The solution was fitted to the numerical integration of the JPL DE403 (Standish et al. 1995). This solution was 10 to 100 times more precise than VSOP82 and VSOP87.

### 3.2. New VSOP Theories

#### 3.2.1. The Works of P. Bretagnon

Starting in VSOP2000, Bretagnon performed 15 additional iterations with a numerical precision 10 times better than VSOP2000, with the following characteristics:

- The Poisson series were developed up to the 12th degree with respect to time
- The eight major planets and the five big asteroids had their orbits analytically computed during the same process
- Perturbations of the Moon issued from ELP2000 (Chapront-Touze & Chapront 1983) on the eight major planets were introduced during the iteration process
- Relativistic corrections were introduced in the iterations
- The solution was fitted to DE403 (Standish et al. 1995) using the inertial mean ecliptic of J2000 defined by Chapront et al. (2002)

Starting from the equatorial rectangular variables $(x, y, z)_{\text{equ}}$ given by DE403, we computed the ecliptic rectangular variables $(x, y, z)_{\text{ecl}}$ by:

$$\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}_{\text{ecl}} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos\varepsilon & \sin\varepsilon \\ 0 & -\sin\varepsilon & \cos\varepsilon \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \cos\varphi & \sin\varphi & 0 \\ -\sin\varphi & \cos\varphi & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix}_{\text{equ}} \tag{3}$$

where $\varepsilon$ and $\varphi$ are issued from Chapront et al. (2002) as:

$$\varepsilon = 23^\circ 26' 21''.40928 \quad \text{and} \quad \varphi = -0''.05294 \tag{4}$$

#### 3.2.2. The Construction of the VSOP2010 and VSOP2013 Solutions

We took Bretagnon's work up again introducing various changes and supplements:

- The integration constants have been computed, first by fitting VSOP2010 to DE405, then to different versions of the INPOP numerical integrations INPOP06, INPOP08, and finally INPOP10a for VSOP2013. These fits were done over the time span from 1890 to 2000.

- We have computed the perturbations due to the $J_2$ of the Sun on the planets Mercury, Venus, EMB, and Mars. The values used for the $J_2$ of the Sun are $2 \times 10^{-7}$ for DE405 and $2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ for INPOP10a.

- We have introduced the perturbations induced by the asteroids as explained in Section 6.

- We have added the perturbations of Pluto on the outer planets in the form of Poisson series as explained in Section 5.4.5.

- Starting from the TOP solutions, we have improved the precision of the theories of Jupiter and Saturn over a large time span as explained in Section 4.3.

- The arguments of the series are linear combinations of 17 angles: the 16 angles of VSOP2000 and the linear function of time $\mu$ defined below.

- The timescale is TDB and the relationship with terrestrial time (TT) depends on the ephemeris. For DE405, one can use TE405 (Irwin & Fukushima 1999). For INPOP10a, the transformation between TT and TDB is numerically integrated with the equations of the motion of the bodies, leading to a 4D-ephemeris (see Fienga et al. 2009).

For the fit to DE405, we use the values given by Chapront et al. (2002):

$$\varepsilon = 23^\circ 26' 21''.40960 \quad \text{and} \quad \varphi = -0''.05028 \tag{5}$$

The fit to INPOP10a is made starting from the equatorial rectangular coordinates of INPOP10a and using the angles given in Eq. (5) to compute the ecliptic rectangular coordinates, then the elliptic elements. The comparison, from 1890 to 2000, with the elliptic elements issued from DE405 gives small corrections $\Delta q$ and $\Delta p$ for $p$ and $q$ of EMB. From these corrections, we deduce the corrections $\Delta\varepsilon$ and $\Delta\varphi$ by:

$$\Delta\varepsilon = 2\Delta q \quad ; \quad \Delta\varphi = \frac{2\Delta p}{\sin\varepsilon} \tag{6}$$

We finally found the values corresponding to INPOP10a:

$$\varepsilon = 23^\circ 26' 21''.41136 \quad \text{and} \quad \varphi = -0''.05188 \tag{7}$$

The values found in Eq. (7) are consistent with the ICRF (International Celestial Reference Frame) definition. Indeed, by the fit of INPOP10a to planet positions obtained by VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) tracking of spacecraft, INPOP10a is directly tied to ICRF at the precision of these observations, about a few mas (Fienga et al. 2011). In consequence, VSOP2013 being fitted to INPOP10a can then be seen as linked to ICRF by means of INPOP10a.

## 4. The TOP Theories

The TOP (Theory of the Outer Planets) theories are analytical theories for the motion of the four large planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

### 4.1. Historical Review

**TOP82** (Simon 1983): In this solution, the perturbations were Poisson series of the mean mean longitudes of the four large planets. A supplementary input was brought to the theory for the couple Jupiter-Saturn by computing, with an iterative method and using harmonic analysis, the mutual perturbations Jupiter-Saturn up to the seventh order with respect to the masses. The relativity was introduced as in VSOP82. The solution also contained the perturbations of the four large planets by the telluric planets at the third order of masses from VSOP82. TOP82 was fitted to DE200.

**JASON84** (Jupiter And Saturn Orbits from Neolithic, Simon & Bretagnon 1984): This was an extension of TOP82 where the mutual perturbations Jupiter-Saturn were computed up to the 20th order of masses. Before the construction of the new TOP solutions, JASON84 was the most precise theory of the motion of Jupiter and Saturn over the time span [J2000-6000, J2000+6000] and was used to build the tables for the motion of those planets in the book *Planetary Programs and Tables from -4000 to +2800* (Bretagnon & Simon 1986).

### 4.2. New TOP Theories

The aim of TOP is not to compete with VSOP over a short time span but to build very precise theories of the four large planets over several thousands of years. For that purpose we use a completely different representation.

#### 4.2.1. The Representation

The solutions are also Poisson series of the form of Eqs. (1), but $X_j^q$ and $L_j^q$ are Fourier series of only one argument $\mu$:

$$X_j^q / L_j^q = \sum_r A_r \cos r\mu + B_r \sin r\mu \tag{8}$$

where $r$ is a positive integer. The maximum value of $r$ is 219 (524,288) and $\mu$ is linked to the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn $n_5$ and $n_6$ by:

$$\mu = (n_5 - n_6)t / 880 = 0.35953623 \, t \tag{9}$$

where $t$ is measured in thousands of years from J2000 and with the values of $n_5$ and $n_6$ given in Table 6. The period of $\mu$ is about 17,485 years.

The mean motions of the four major planets are linked to $\mu$ by relations of the form:

$$n_5 t = 1473\mu + \sigma_5 t = 1473\mu + 0.09409555 \, t \tag{10}$$
$$n_6 t = 593\mu + \sigma_6 t = 593\mu + 0.09409555 \, t$$
$$n_7 t = 208\mu + \sigma_7 t = 208\mu - 0.00187389 \, t$$
$$n_8 t = 106\mu + \sigma_8 t = 106\mu + 0.02213213 \, t$$

This representation was chosen because perturbations are more convergent using this form than the classical form of Poisson series of the mean mean longitudes for Jupiter and Saturn because the choice of $\mu$ allows us to take into account an important part of the development with respect to the time of the long periods of a general theory of the couple Jupiter-Saturn (Simon et al. 1992). For Uranus and Neptune, the convergence is the same as in the classical form.

#### 4.2.2. Construction of the Solution

The solution is computed by the iterative method of Simon & Joutel (1988). The Lagrange equations are $\frac{dx}{dt} = F(\mu, t)$, with $F(\mu, t_i)$ computed by harmonic analysis, for 13 values of the time $t_0, t_0 + \Delta t, t_0 - \Delta t, \ldots, t_0 + 6\Delta t, t_0 - 6\Delta t$, with $t_0$ corresponding to J2000 and $\Delta t = 1200$ yrs. After interpolation and integration, the solution has the form of Eqs. (1) with $p = 12$. The integration constants have been computed by fitting TOP2010 to DE405 and TOP2013 to INPOP10a, over the time span from 1890 to 2000.

#### 4.2.3. Perturbations by the Telluric Planets

For TOP2010, we used the perturbations by the telluric planets developed up to the third order of the masses extracted from VSOP82. They are written as $\mu$ series and are introduced in the iterations.

For TOP2013, we obtain these perturbations by computing the differences between the last iteration of the iterative process used for VSOP2013 and the last iteration computed without taking into account the telluric planets. This method gives a better estimation of the perturbations by the telluric planets as will be seen in Section 7.3.2.

#### 4.2.4. Heliocentric Spherical and Rectangular Variables

It is easy to compute by harmonic analysis the heliocentric spherical variables (longitude, latitude, radius vector) and the heliocentric rectangular variables $(X, Y, Z)$ from the elliptic elements, under the form of Poisson series of $\mu$. These variables have been introduced in the TOP solutions.

### 4.3. Amelioration of VSOP Theories Using TOP Theories

The good convergence of the mutual perturbations Jupiter-Saturn in the TOP solution can be used to improve the perturbations corresponding to some periodic terms in the VSOP representation of the semi-major axis and the mean longitude of these two planets.

As an example of how the VSOP improvement is obtained for the Jupiter mean longitude development we take the argument $4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6$.

#### 4.3.1. VSOP and TOP Developments

In VSOP, this development has the form:

$$L_v = \sum_{p=0}^{11} t^p \left[ s_{4-10}^p \sin(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) + c_{4-10}^p \cos(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) \right] \tag{11}$$

This argument corresponds to the TOP argument $38\mu$. The TOP development has the form:

$$L_t = \sum_{q=0}^{12} t^q \left[ s_{38}^q \sin(38\mu) + c_{38}^q \cos(38\mu) \right] \tag{12}$$

#### 4.3.2. TOP Developed in VSOP Form

From Eqs. (10), we find:

$$38\mu = -(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) - 0.56457330 \, t \tag{13}$$

where $t$ is measured in thousands of years from J2000.

Substituting the value of $38\mu$ given by Eq. (13) in Eq. (12), we obtain a Poisson development issued from TOP but under the VSOP representation. Up to $t^{20}$ this development has the form:

$$L_{tv} = \sum_{r=0}^{20} t^r \left[ s'^r_{4-10} \sin(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) + c'^r_{4-10} \cos(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) \right] \tag{14}$$

#### 4.3.4. Correction of the VSOP Development

The VSOP and TOP theories have been built in different ways and their integration constants are not the same. After some tests, we have estimated that the best correction for this argument is to add to the VSOP coefficients the differences between the coefficients of Eq. (13) and the coefficients of Eq. (11) starting from Poisson terms in $t^9$:

$$\delta L_v = \sum_{r=9}^{20} t^r \left[ \delta s^r_{4-10} \sin(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) + \delta c^r_{4-10} \cos(4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6) \right] \tag{15}$$

#### 4.3.5. Application of the Method

This method has been applied to the Poisson developments of the semi-major axis and the mean longitude of Jupiter and Saturn for the 12 arguments:

| Argument | ($\mu$ multiple) |
|----------|------------------|
| $4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 11\bar{\lambda}_6 + 3\bar{\lambda}_7$ | (7$\mu$) |
| $2\bar{\lambda}_5 - 6\bar{\lambda}_6 + 3\bar{\lambda}_7$ | (12$\mu$) |
| $2\bar{\lambda}_5 - 5\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (19$\mu$) |
| $6\bar{\lambda}_5 - 16\bar{\lambda}_6 + 3\bar{\lambda}_7$ | (26$\mu$) |
| $4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 10\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (38$\mu$) |
| $8\bar{\lambda}_5 - 21\bar{\lambda}_6 + 3\bar{\lambda}_7$ | (45$\mu$) |
| $6\bar{\lambda}_5 - 15\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (57$\mu$) |
| $8\bar{\lambda}_5 - 20\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (76$\mu$) |
| $7\bar{\lambda}_5 - 17\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (230$\mu$) |
| $4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 12\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (249$\mu$) |
| $6\bar{\lambda}_5 - 14\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (536$\mu$) |
| $4\bar{\lambda}_5 - 9\bar{\lambda}_6$ | (555$\mu$) |

Though not rigorous, this method significantly improves the precision of VSOP for large time spans.

#### 4.3.6. Degree of the Poisson Development in VSOP

With these complements, the Poisson series of VSOP2013 and VSOP2010 are developed up to the 20th degree with respect to time.

## 5. Theory of the Motion of Pluto

### 5.1. Perturbations by Pluto on the Major Planets

To obtain a precise theory of the major planets, especially for Uranus and Neptune, it is necessary to include the perturbations due to Pluto (or, more exactly, of the Pluto-Charon barycenter) and, therefore, to build an analytical theory of Pluto at least at the first order of masses.

### 5.2. Construction of the Theory of Pluto in the Classical Form

A very close Neptune-Pluto resonance is the argument $2\bar{\lambda}_8 - 3\bar{\lambda}_9$ with a period of about 20,000 years, where $\bar{\lambda}_8$ and $\bar{\lambda}_9$ are the mean mean longitudes of Neptune and Pluto, respectively.

#### Table 3: Perturbations at the First Order of the Masses for the Mean Longitudes

Comparison between Saturn perturbed by Jupiter and Pluto perturbed by Neptune (amplitudes in radians):

| Rank | Saturn/Jupiter | | Pluto/Neptune | |
|------|----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| | Argument | Amplitude | Argument | Amplitude |
| 1 | $2\bar{\lambda}_5 - 5\bar{\lambda}_6$ | 0.013 | $2\bar{\lambda}_8 - 3\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 4.56 |
| 2 | $\bar{\lambda}_5 - \bar{\lambda}_6$ | 3 x 10^-3 | $4\bar{\lambda}_8 - 6\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 1.08 |
| 3 | $\bar{\lambda}_5 - 2\bar{\lambda}_6$ | 2 x 10^-3 | $6\bar{\lambda}_8 - 9\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 0.40 |
| 10 | $3\bar{\lambda}_5 - 4\bar{\lambda}_6$ | 1 x 10^-4 | $20\bar{\lambda}_8 - 30\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 1 x 10^-2 |
| 100 | $14\bar{\lambda}_5 - 16\bar{\lambda}_6$ | 8 x 10^-8 | $13\bar{\lambda}_8 - 18\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 4 x 10^-5 |
| 329 | $17\bar{\lambda}_5 - 25\bar{\lambda}_6$ | 5 x 10^-11 | $82\bar{\lambda}_8 - 23\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 5 x 10^-6 |
| 1000 | -- | -- | $24\bar{\lambda}_8 - 42\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 8 x 10^-7 |
| 15539 | -- | -- | $155\bar{\lambda}_8 - 220\bar{\lambda}_9$ | 5 x 10^-11 |

The amplitude of the most important perturbation of the mean longitude of Pluto (4.56 rad = 9.4 x 10^5 arcsec), which corresponds to the resonance $2\bar{\lambda}_8 - 3\bar{\lambda}_9$, is greater than the most important perturbation of the mean longitude of Saturn (0.013 rad = 2.7 x 10^3 arcsec) by a factor of 350. Moreover, the number of terms greater than 5 x 10^-11 rad (0.01 mas) is 329 for Saturn perturbed by Jupiter and 15,539 for Pluto perturbed by Neptune.

### 5.3. Choice of a New Argument for the Representation

We chose a representation with an argument $\nu$ such that the resonance should correspond to $0\nu$. So, the perturbations corresponding to the resonance should be expanded in polynomials of time. We then take:

$$\nu = n_8 t / 105 = 0.36317117 \, t \tag{18}$$

where $t$ is measured in thousands of years from J2000 and with $n_8$ given in Table 6. This argument is very near to $\mu$ given by Eq. (9) and we obtain $n_9 t = 70\nu - 0.08632137 \, t$. The resonance corresponds then to $0\nu$.

### 5.4. Construction of the Analytical Theory of Pluto

We built our theory of Pluto as explained in Simon (2004). As for the VSOP and TOP solutions, we built two solutions fitted to DE405 and INPOP10a, respectively.

#### 5.4.1. First Order Theory

We first computed the mutual perturbations Jupiter-Pluto, Saturn-Pluto, Uranus-Pluto, and Neptune-Pluto in Poisson series of $\nu$. The mutual perturbation Neptune-Pluto are computed without difficulties. For instance, the mean longitude of Pluto contains, for this couple, 44 terms with an amplitude greater than 0.01 mas (the amplitude of the most important term being about 3000 arcsec) and 250 Poisson terms giving contributions greater than 0.01 mas over 1000 yrs.

#### 5.4.3. The Resonance $2\bar{\lambda}_8 - 3\bar{\lambda}_9$ (0$\nu$)

The secular terms corresponding to the resonance converge perfectly and decrease with time as can be seen in Table 4 which gives the values of the secular terms of the mean longitude of Pluto in arcsec/1000 yrs:

#### Table 4: Secular Terms of the Mean Longitude of Pluto

| $t^2$ | $t^3$ | $t^4$ | $t^5$ | $t^6$ | $t^7$ | $t^8$ | $t^9$ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 3770 | 397 | 20 | 7 | 0.7 | 0.1 | 0.03 | 0.0005 |

(Units: arcsec/1000 yrs)

#### 5.4.4. The Argument $\bar{\lambda}_7 - 3\bar{\lambda}_9$

This argument has a period of 4000 yrs and corresponds to the argument $4\nu$ like the great inequality Uranus-Neptune $\bar{\lambda}_7 - 2\bar{\lambda}_8$. This argument is known as a long short-period argument, i.e. an argument with a period similar to the periods of the long-period arguments of general theories. As shown by Joutel (1990), in a classical planetary theory, the perturbations corresponding to this type of argument do not converge well. Here, the amplitude is about 700 arcsec for the mean longitude of Pluto with an error of about 10 arcsec.

#### 5.4.5. Introduction of the Theories of Pluto in TOP and VSOP

The Poisson series of $\nu$ do not have a convergence as good as the series of $\mu$ for Jupiter and Saturn. For that reason, we kept $\mu$ as the argument of the TOP solutions and transformed in Poisson series of $\mu$ the Poisson series of $\nu$ corresponding to the complete solution of Pluto. Moreover, we transformed in Poisson series of $\mu$ the perturbations of Pluto on the major planets and we added them to the VSOP and TOP solutions of the major planets. So $\mu$ becomes an argument of the Poisson series of VSOP. At last, we have introduced the theory of the motion of Pluto in both TOP and VSOP solutions.

## 6. Perturbations by the Asteroids

### 6.1. Representation of the Perturbations

We introduced the analytical perturbations of the asteroids considered by numerical planetary ephemerides on the eight major planets. These perturbations are computed at the first order of masses and have the form of Poisson series of $\mu$ as explained in Fienga & Simon (2005).

For each variable and each planet-asteroid couple, the first order perturbations are computed by harmonic analysis (Simon 1986) in the form of Fourier series. The arguments of the series have the form $i\bar{\lambda}_p + j\bar{\lambda}_a$, where $i$ and $j$ are integers and $\bar{\lambda}_p$ and $\bar{\lambda}_a$ are the mean mean longitudes of the planet and the asteroid, respectively.

Then, writing $in_p + jn_a = q\mu + \epsilon$ where $q$ is an integer and $\epsilon$ is as small as possible, we transform the Fourier series of mean mean longitudes in Poisson series of $\mu$. By addition of the Poisson series given by all the asteroids, we obtain, finally, for each variable of each planet, the perturbations under the form of only one Poisson series of $\mu$.

### 6.2. The Asteroids in DE405 and INPOP10a

The integration of the motion of the asteroids is not done in the same way for DE405 and INPOP10a.

**DE405:** The orbits of Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta under their own gravitational forces, those of the Sun, the planets, and the Moon are integrated separately from the planet integration. The orbits of the 297 asteroids (Iris and Bamberga included) are also integrated separately under the gravitational forces of the Sun, the planets, the Moon, Ceres, Pallas, and Vesta, but only the action of these 297 asteroids upon Mars, the Earth, and the Moon, as well as their contributions to the solar system barycenter, are included in the planetary integration.

**INPOP10a:** 165 asteroids are integrated with the planets and their perturbations are taken into account for all the planets. The analytical first order perturbations by the asteroids is a first approach of the complete perturbations of the asteroids on the planets. So the model of the VSOP solutions is closer to INPOP10a model than the DE405 one.

The motion of the five big asteroids are included in the iterative process of VSOP. So, the first order perturbations are computed for 295 asteroids in VSOP2010 and for 160 asteroids in VSOP2013. For TOP2010 and TOP2013, the perturbations are computed for the 300 asteroids of DE405 and for the 165 asteroids of INPOP10a, respectively.

## 7. Results

### 7.1. Integration Constants and Mean Elements

Mean elements of the variables $x_j$ and $\lambda_j$, referred to J2000, are the secular parts of the Eqs. (1):

$$\langle x_j \rangle = x_j^0 + x_j^1 t + \ldots + x_j^p t^p \tag{19}$$
$$\langle \lambda_j \rangle = \lambda_j^0 + n_j t + l_j^2 t^2 + \ldots + l_j^p t^p$$

The mean elements are useful for:
- The determination of the starting integration constants in building classical planetary theories
- The determination of the integration constants of general planetary theories (Laskar 1988)
- The amelioration of general planetary theories by fitting the long-period terms of these theories to the mean elements of classical theories (Bretagnon & Simon 1990)

It is possible to obtain approximate ephemerides of the planets by adding the small Poisson series of $\mu$ given by Simon et al. (1994) to the mean elements. For the heliocentric longitudes, the precision of these approximate ephemerides is about a few arcseconds for the telluric planets and Neptune and about a few tens of arcseconds for the other planets over the time span from 1000 to 3000.

Units for truncation levels: au for semi-major axis, rad for mean longitude, dimensionless for $k$, $h$, $q$, $p$.

For the small levels of truncation, the TOP solutions are more compact than the VSOP solutions for the major planets due to both the best convergence of the Poisson series in the TOP representation and because numerous VSOP terms of a period superior to 1000 yrs are represented in TOP by the same small multiples of $\mu$ (smaller than 17$\mu$).

Reference integrations: INPOP10a for VSOP2013, DE405 for VSOP2010, DE403 for VSOP2000.

The accuracy of VSOP2013 is very good. The precision of the mean longitudes is about a few 0.01 mas for Mercury, Venus, EMB, Saturn, and Neptune, 0.2 mas for Jupiter, and 0.7 mas for Mars and Uranus. Related to VSOP2000, the improvement is about a factor of 2 for Uranus and up to 24 for EMB and Neptune.

Reference integrations: INPOP10a for TOP2013, DE405 for TOP2010.

The orbits of the telluric planets are not integrated with the major planets and the TOP theories cannot be as accurate as the VSOP theories over short time spans. Nevertheless, TOP2013 is more precise than TOP2010 thanks to the method used for computing the perturbations by the telluric planets.

For Pluto, over the time span from 1890 to 2000, the accuracy is about 3 mas for the mean longitude, about 125 km for $a$, and $2 \times 10^{-8}$ for $k$ and $h$. This accuracy is far below the actual uncertainties of the Pluto observations.

From -4000 to 8000, the precision is better than 0.2 arcsec for Mercury and Venus, about 1 arcsec for EMB, and 1.7 arcsec for Mars. The improvement is about a factor of 5 compared to VSOP2000. The precision decreases with time more quickly for EMB and Mars than for Mercury and Venus due to the perturbations by the asteroids which should be computed at the second order of masses to improve the accuracy.

From -4000 to 8000, TOP2013 remains the more precise solution. The precision of the heliocentric longitudes is about 0.4 arcsec for Jupiter, 0.7 arcsec for Uranus and Neptune, and 0.9 arcsec for Saturn. The gain in precision, compared to VSOP2013, is between 10 and 15 for Jupiter and Saturn and between 1.5 and 4 for Uranus and Neptune.

The improvement due to the supplementary material from TOP2013 is about a factor of 5 for the mean and heliocentric longitudes of Jupiter and Saturn.

For Pluto, the precision remains good from 900 to 3100 (about 0.8 arcsec for the heliocentric longitude) and still correct from 0 to 4000 (about 12 arcsec). For larger time spans, the precision quickly decreases, but the existence of a libration of the longitude of Pluto, with a period about 19,900 yrs (Milani et al. 1989), means that we cannot hope to build an analytical solution of Pluto valid over time spans greater than a few thousand years.

### 7.5. The Solutions on the WEB Server of the IMCCE

#### 7.5.1. The VSOP2013 Solution

Available at: ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/vsop2013

Contents:
- The complete Poisson developments of the elliptic variables of the eight planets and Pluto
- Developments in the form of Tchebychev polynomials for the heliocentric rectangular coordinates (positions and velocities) of the eight planets over different time spans
- The mean elements of the elliptic variables of the eight planets
- Subroutines for reading the developments and computing the coordinates for given values of time

#### 7.5.2. The TOP2013 Solution

Available at: ftp://ftp.imcce.fr/pub/ephem/planets/top2013

The TOP2013 solution is much more compact than VSOP2013 and it is not necessary to use developments under the form of Tchebychev polynomials.

Contents:
- The complete Poisson developments of the elliptic variables (four major planets and Pluto) and of the heliocentric spherical and rectangular variables (four major planets)
- The mean elements of the elliptic variables of the four major planets and Pluto
- Subroutines for reading the developments and computing the coordinates for given values of time

### 7.6. Possible Improvements

**For VSOP2013:**
- Improve the accuracy of the motion of the telluric planets (specially EMB and Mars) over large time spans by computing the perturbations of the asteroids on the planets to the second order of masses
- Improve the accuracy of the motion of Jupiter and Saturn over large time spans by developing the Poisson series up to the 20th degree with respect to time
- Improve the accuracy of the relativistic corrections, using the techniques suggested by Brumberg (2012)

**For TOP2013:**
- Improve the modelling of the perturbations due to the telluric planets. Integrating the motion of the telluric planets in the iterative process would not be easy because the computation of very short periods in the motion of Mercury would lead to important difficulties in the harmonic analysis. A better method would be to do two kinds of iterations in the VSOP process, one with the telluric planets, another without. The difference between the two processes should give a good estimation of the perturbations of the telluric planets on the outer planets.

## 8. Conclusion

The new analytical theories VSOP2013 and TOP2013 built at the IMCCE are complementary and have been greatly enhanced since the previous versions. They are fitted to INPOP10a, a numerical integration of the motion of the planets that takes into account more recent observations.

**VSOP2013** is the best analytical theory for the motion of the eight solar system planets over time spans of a few hundred years. The improvement over VSOP2000 is about a factor of 2 for Uranus, 5 for Mars and Jupiter, and greater than 10 for the other planets. Moreover, VSOP2013 remains very accurate over large time spans for the motion of the telluric planets.

**TOP2013** was developed in a compact and easy to use form. It is the most precise theory for the motion of the four major planets over large time spans; TOP2013 also gives a solution of the motion of the Pluto-Charon barycenter with good accuracy up to time spans of a few thousand years.

The subroutines used to build VSOP2013 and TOP2013 are ready to fit these theories to new versions of INPOP.
